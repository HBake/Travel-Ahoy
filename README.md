I was the product owner and scrum master of my Programming Studio group for our final Project, Travel Ahoy.

Our project, Travel Ahoy!, is a web based application that is designed to allow users to easily plan out trips from one country to another. While our project is mostly based in the European continent the scope of our project can be expanded to include other countries around the world, currently supported is United States, United Kingdom, India, Spain, and Germany. Travel Ahoy's main purpose is to provide users with travel information through different methods of traveling, but also their destination information with it. This format allows us to not only give our users multiple options, it also allows us to calculate the cheapest and fastest travel options for the user - giving them control to their preferred method of travel. Furthermore, Travel Ahoy provides different types of information such as: News (of your destination), Point of Interests, 7 day forecast of the weather, and a graph displaying the current covid condition. Finally, we give users the ability to plan their return date flights so that they can clearly plan out their vacation. 

Since we were required to use a github enterprise account for this project, the commit history has unfortunately been lost.
